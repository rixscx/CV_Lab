# **Image Segmentation by Clustering for k value 2:**
Applies K-means clustering to segment the image into 2 distinct regions or clusters based on pixel color similarities. This technique simplifies the image into two primary areas, which can be useful for distinguishing between foreground and background or two different objects.
```
Output:
```

# **Finding the Optimal K-value through Elbow Method:**
The Elbow method helps determine the optimal number of clusters (K) for K-means clustering by plotting the sum of squared distances (inertia) from each point to its assigned cluster center. The "elbow" point on the plot indicates the optimal K, where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the clustering performance.
```
Output:
```

# **Image Preprocessing and Optimal K-means Clustering for Segmentation:**
Involves preprocessing the image (e.g., resizing, color space conversion) before applying K-means clustering. The optimal number of clusters (K) is determined using the Elbow method, and K-means clustering is applied with this optimal K to segment the image effectively, resulting in better segmentation performance.
